I was a PhD student, supervised by Giulio and Daniel Stouffer (from the School of Biological Sciences) at UC. In general I enjoy adopting an interdisciplinary approach to data-driven projects to find innovative ways to solve ecology-related problems. To achieve this, over the past years I have used various methods ranging from data collection using different field techniques, quantitative analysis using network-related and other statistical models. During my PhD my research was focused on the application and extension of network models to understand and predict human-mediated dispersal of exotic species to natural areas using visitors' movement to improve biosecurity interventions in New Zealand. I live off cakes, coffee and peanut butter. When I am not on campus, you can find me on an aerial hoop.
