I recently finished my PhD (August 2021) at UC under the supervision of Giulio and Daniel Stouffer (from the School of Biological Sciences). During my PhD, most of my research was focused on the application and extension of network models in the context biosecurity interventions in New Zealand. Since September, I am an Experiential AI postdoc at Northeastern University (Boston) under the supervision of Albert-László Barabási and Tina Eliassi-Rad. As part of this fellowship, I am developing new tools at the interface of Network Science and Machine Learning to predict evolution in non-stationary multi-scale networks. In general, I enjoy adopting an interdisciplinary approach to data-driven projects to find innovative ways to solve ecology-related problems. When I am not on campus, you can find on an aerial silk or trying some new classes at the gym!
