I am a senior academic staff at Ara Institute of Canterbury, Architectural Studies, myself a survivor of the 2019 Mosque shootings in Ōtautahi Christchurch. Since then, I have collected the documentation and images of more than 100 displays of kindness including memorial events, vigils, kapa haka performances, tribute shows, bicycle rides, community dinners and interfaith gatherings. I've used the material that I documented to develop a course, _Using Aroha to Dismantle Hate in Aotearoa_, which I'm delivering to various groups, including the New Zealand Police, religious groups, and other professionals.
