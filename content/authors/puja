I am PhD student from the University of Canterbury under the supervision of Giulio Dalla Riva. My research project is to develop an open Urban data Centre for City of Otautahi, Christchurch through a community-led approach. Inspired by the idea of data for building relationship.  I like to take a business question or a need or a problem and transforming it into a data question and pretty interested to extract an answer to that question from the data. Looking to find interesting trends or relationships in the data, making predictions and automation of existing systems are my favorite parts which I enjoy doing the most in this field.
