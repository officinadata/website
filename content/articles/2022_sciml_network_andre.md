# Julia and SciML for Dynamical Complex Networks

Andre Macleod has given a talk at the 2022 JuliaCon illustrating some of our work on merging some of the exciting new techinques of scientific machine learning ([sciml](www.sciml.ai)) and the study of dynamical complex networks.

Here's the video on youtube:
